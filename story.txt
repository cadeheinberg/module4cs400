A man went to Rhetas and ordered a large pie. 
He ate the pie and got food poisoning.
That man was also me.

He fell on the floor writhing in pain as the festering pie sat deep in his bowels.
The pie was so rancid and the food poisoning so strong that he got a stroke and died on the spot.

The authorities determined the immediate area to be a biohazard zone.  Nobody went in, nobody went out.
Due to the incredibly torturous entity that was the pie being too dangerous to be disposed normally,
it was decided that the body should be shot into the sun.
So it was.
The end.
